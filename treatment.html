<p>Chemotheraphy:</p>
<p>Chemotherapy is a drug treatment that uses powerful chemicals to kill fast-growing cells in your body. Chemotherapy is most often used to treat cancer, since cancer cells grow and multiply much more quickly than most cells in the body. Many different chemotherapy drugs are available.

<p>Radiotheraphy:</p>
<p>At high doses, radiation therapy kills cancer cells or slows their growth by damaging their DNA. Cancer cells whose DNA is damaged beyond repair stop dividing or die. When the damaged cells die, they are broken down and removed by the body.

Radiation therapy does not kill cancer cells right away. It takes days or weeks of treatment before DNA is damaged enough for cancer cells to die. Then, cancer cells keep dying for weeks or months after radiation therapy ends.
</p>
<p>Tyes of Radiation:</p>
<p>There are two main types of radiation therapy, external beam and internal.

The type of radiation therapy that you may have depends on many factors, including:</p>

<p>*The type of cancer</p>
<p>*The size of the tumor</p>
<p>*The tumorâ€™s location in the body</p>
<p>*How close the tumor is to normal tissues that are sensitive to radiation</p>
<p>*Your general health and medical history</p>
